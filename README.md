Followed a tutorial on Microsoft's web site on how to create a web api project using asp.net and c#.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio 

It was not very informative and the last section with adding jquery was hard to follow. I wasn't told the correct information for a total beginner and got confused, but managed to figure it out.
